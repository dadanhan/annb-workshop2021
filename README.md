Docs for the ANNB workshop 2021

This is a basic workshop showing you how to:
1. setup Python3 and tensorflow
2. create and train basic supervised neural networks in tensorflow on images
3. create and train basic unsupervised neural networks from scratch on images
4. create and train basic supervised neural networks in tensorflow on time series and apply this to tracking data of endosomes

Let's begin with installation.
